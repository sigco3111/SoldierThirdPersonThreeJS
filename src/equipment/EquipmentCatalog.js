/**
 * What can be equipped, and where.

 * This file is the whole content layer: adding a sword is one entry here and no
 * code anywhere else. Everything downstream — the loader, the attachment mounts,
 * the character screen's item list — is driven off these objects and knows
 * nothing about any particular item.
 *
 * Categories exist so the two kinds of thing stay separable. `weapons` is the
 * category that will grow rules (draw/sheathe, damage, a hand it has to be in);
 * `attachments` is cosmetic and never will. Keeping them apart now is what makes
 * that later work a change to one category rather than a filter over a flat list.
