/**
 * The pointer, for the whole stage.
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * One click takes the mouse, and from then on moving it turns the view rather
 * than dragging a cursor across it. `Esc` gives the cursor back. That is the
 * whole of the mode, and it is the mode the *entire* play stage runs in — not
 * only the rifle's. A third-person game whose camera is captured while one
 * weapon is out and dragged while the other is out is two games, and the
 * player has to notice which one they are in before they can turn around.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here rather than in the shooter
 *
 * It started in `combat/Gunplay.js`, because the rifle is what needed it
 * first: a reticle nailed to the middle of the screen and a cursor that has to
 * be dragged to aim are incompatible. But nothing about *taking the pointer*
 * is about the gun. The gun's share is what the buttons then mean — the
 * trigger, the sights, the shoulder — and that stayed there. What is here is
 * the pointer itself: who has it, how a movement becomes a turn, and what
 * hands it back.
 *
 * ## The two states, and the way between them
 *
 * **Captured** is the playing state. OrbitControls is stood down for as long
 * as it lasts (`CameraRig#setPointerLocked`), because a locked pointer reports
 * no page coordinates at all and a drag it half-saw would fight the look for
 * the same orbit. The deltas go to `CameraRig#look` instead, scaled by
 * `settings.camera.sensitivity` and by whatever the caller's `sensitivity`
 * hook says on top of it — which is how sighting down the rifle slows the
 * whole view without this file knowing a rifle exists.
 *
 * **Free** is every menu. The browser's own `Esc` is the way into it, so it
 * costs nothing to learn and works even where a key handler never sees the
 * press (Chrome swallows the `keydown` that exits a lock). While it lasts the
 * orbit drag comes back, so the camera is still usable with a cursor — the
 * editor (`G`), the panels along the bottom and the character screen are all
 * pointed at the ordinary way. Clicking the canvas takes the pointer again.
 *
 * The press that takes it is spent on taking it and on nothing else: it is
 * stopped in the capture phase before the canvas's own listeners can read it
 * as an orbit drag, a mark or a round. This is the click that focuses a window
 * after an alt-tab, and firing on it is how a magazine goes missing.
 *
 * ## What blocks it
 *
 * `blocked` — the character screen, and nothing else at present. That is a
 * place you point at things with a cursor, so the pointer is given back on the
 * way in and never taken while it is up.
